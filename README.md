### ✅ STEP 1: **Create Your QuickBooks Account**

1. Go to [quickbooks.intuit.com](https://quickbooks.intuit.com)
2. Click **“Start Free Trial”** or **“Buy Now”**
3. Sign up with your **email + password**
4. Answer basic questions about your business (name, industry, etc.)

---

### ✅ STEP 2: **Set Up Your Company Info**

Fill in your:

* Business name (e.g., "Lili’s Uber Delivery")
* Business address & phone
* Industry type (e.g., Food Delivery, Landscaping, Retail)
* Business type: Sole Proprietor, LLC, etc.

---

### ✅ STEP 3: **Create Your Chart of Accounts**

The **Chart of Accounts** is like a big filing cabinet. Each drawer holds a type of money activity.

You’ll get some default accounts. You can:

* Keep them (e.g., **Bank**, **Sales Income**, **Utilities Expense**)
* Add your own (e.g., **Uber Ride Income**, **Delivery Fees**, **Fuel Expense**)

📝 **Example Accounts to Add:**

* 💰 **Bank Account** – where money comes in/out
* 📦 **Inventory** – if you sell products
* 📈 **Sales Income** – for all customer payments
* 🧾 **Marketing Expense** – ads, flyers
* 🚗 **Fuel Expense** – for Uber/gas

---

### ✅ STEP 4: **Link Your Bank Account (Optional but Powerful)**

This allows QuickBooks to:

* Pull in transactions automatically
* Categorize them for you
* Make reconciliation much easier

🔗 How:

1. Go to **Banking** tab
2. Click **Link Account**
3. Sign into your bank securely
4. Choose the date range for transactions to pull

---

### ✅ STEP 5: **Add Your Customers and Vendors**

* Customers = People who pay you (e.g., clients, platforms like Uber Eats)
* Vendors = People/companies you pay (e.g., gas stations, Facebook ads)

💡 You can add them manually or import them from a spreadsheet.

---

### ✅ STEP 6: **Start Recording Transactions**

If you didn’t link a bank, you can **enter them manually**:

* Click **+ New** at the top

  * Select **Invoice**, **Sales Receipt**, **Expense**, etc.
* Fill out each form with the amount, date, account, and notes

---

### ✅ STEP 7: **Categorize Transactions**

If you linked your bank:

* Go to **Banking**
* You’ll see **transactions to review**
* Click each one and choose the correct **category** (e.g., Fuel Expense, Sales Income)

---

### ✅ STEP 8: **Reconcile Your Bank Account**

At month-end:

1. Go to **Accounting > Reconcile**
2. Select your bank account
3. Enter the ending balance from your bank statement
4. Match transactions in QuickBooks to the real ones

✅ You should end with a \$0 difference.

---

### ✅ STEP 9: **Run Financial Reports**

Now that your books are up to date:

* Click **Reports**
* View:

  * **Profit & Loss** (income - expenses)
  * **Balance Sheet** (assets - liabilities)
  * **Cash Flow**

---

### ✅ STEP 10: **Keep It Going!**

* Update your books weekly or monthly
* Categorize and reconcile transactions regularly
* Back up your data or use cloud syncing

---
---


### ✅ When you run a **report in QuickBooks** (like Profit & Loss or Balance Sheet):

You **do NOT need to run reports separately** for each bank or credit card account — **QuickBooks includes everything automatically**.

---

### 🧾 Here's what happens:

#### 1. **Profit & Loss Report** (P\&L)

* **Shows your income and expenses**
* It doesn't care *where* the money came from (bank or credit card)
* It only shows the **category** (e.g., Sales Income, Fuel Expense, etc.)

➡️ Example:
If you buy gas with your credit card, it shows under **Fuel Expense** in the report — not “credit card.”

---

#### 2. **Balance Sheet Report**

* This report **does show each account separately** (bank, credit card, etc.)
* You will see:

  * ✅ All **Bank accounts** (under Assets)
  * 💳 All **Credit Cards** (under Liabilities)
  * 📈 Equity and other assets

---

### 💡 Summary:

| Report Type       | Do you need separate reports? | What it shows                       |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| **Profit & Loss** | ❌ No                          | Only income & expenses by category  |
| **Balance Sheet** | ❌ No (shows all in one)       | Bank, Credit Card, Equity, etc.     |
| **Cash Flow**     | ❌ No                          | Shows movement of money (bank only) |

---

---

Yes — **QuickBooks Online is perfect** for both:

---

### ✅ 1. **Your Own Business (e.g., Lili’s Uber Delivery)**

You can:

* Track **income from Uber rides or deliveries**
* Record **expenses** like fuel, car maintenance, tolls
* Link your **bank and credit card** to auto-import transactions
* Categorize everything for **tax time**
* Generate reports like **Profit & Loss**, **Mileage**, and **Tax Summary**

💡 **It helps you act like your own bookkeeper.**

---

### ✅ 2. **Virtual Bookkeeping Business (helping others)**

You can:

* Use QuickBooks to manage bookkeeping for other businesses
* Log in to **clients’ QuickBooks accounts remotely**
* Help them with:

  * Categorizing transactions
  * Reconciling bank statements
  * Sending invoices
  * Generating financial reports
* Become a **QuickBooks ProAdvisor** to get certified and attract clients

💼 It helps you be a **freelance or virtual bookkeeper**.

---

### 🧾 Example:

Let’s say you’re both:

* 👩‍💼 **Lili the Uber driver** — use QuickBooks to track your own rides, fuel, expenses
* 👩‍💻 **Lili the bookkeeper** — use QuickBooks to help clients like a bakery, online shop, handyman, etc.

---

### 💡 One Tip:

You should create **separate QuickBooks accounts**:

* One for your **personal Uber delivery business**
* One for **each client**, or log into their account as their bookkeeper

---

---

### ✅ WHY You Should Create Separate QuickBooks Accounts:

| Use Case                                   | Should You Use a Separate QuickBooks Account? | Why?                                                                 |
| ------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Your own Uber delivery business**        | ✅ Yes                                         | To keep your personal income and expenses separate from your clients |
| **Client bookkeeping work**                | ✅ Yes                                         | Each client must have their own QuickBooks file/account              |
| **Another business you own**               | ✅ Yes                                         | Each business needs its own books, bank links, and reports           |
| **Mixing multiple clients in one account** | ❌ No                                          | This causes confusion, incorrect reports, and tax issues             |

---

### 💡 Think of QuickBooks like a folder — one folder = one business.

If you’re running:

* 🚗 **Lili’s Uber Delivery**
* 📦 Helping a **Bakery**
* 💇 Helping a **Hair Salon**

👉 Each one needs its **own QuickBooks Online account** (or login access to theirs).

---

### ✅ HOW to Set It Up:

#### 1. **Your Own Uber Delivery:**

* Sign up at [quickbooks.intuit.com](https://quickbooks.intuit.com)
* Use your email and create a company called **“Lili’s Uber Delivery”**
* Set up accounts for **Uber Income**, **Fuel Expense**, **Car Maintenance**, etc.

#### 2. **Your Client’s Bookkeeping:**

* Ask the client to:

  * Invite you as their bookkeeper (via email)
  * OR give you access to their QuickBooks Online
* You do **NOT** need to create a new QuickBooks file — they already have one

#### 3. **Another Business You Own:**

* Log out of your Uber QuickBooks
* Sign up again with a **different email** (or the same if using QuickBooks Accountant)
* Set up a new file just for that business

---

### 🔄 Optional: Use **QuickBooks Online Accountant (QBOA)**

---

---

Great question! Here's the **simple answer**:

---

### ✅ **Generally, the invitation is sent by the QuickBooks Online Accountant (QBOA)**

**The Accountant (or Bookkeeper)** is the one who:

* Logs into their **QBOA dashboard**

---

### 💡 Why?

Because in real life:

* The **accountant/bookkeeper** uses QBOA to manage multiple clients
* They initiate the connection so they can start working on the client’s books

---

| ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
