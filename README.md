### ✅ STEP 1: **Create Your QuickBooks Account**

1. Go to (https://quickbooks.intuit.com/free-trial/)
2. Click **“Start Free Trial”** or **“Buy Now”**
3. Sign up with your **email + password**
4. Answer basic questions about your business (name, industry, etc.)

---

### ✅ STEP 2: **Set Up Your Company Info**

Fill in your:

* Business name (e.g., "Lili’s Uber Delivery")
* Business address & phone
* Industry type (e.g., Food Delivery, Landscaping, Retail)
* Business type: Sole Proprietor, LLC, etc.

---

### ✅ STEP 3: **Create Your Chart of Accounts**

The **Chart of Accounts** is like a big filing cabinet. Each drawer holds a type of money activity.

You’ll get some default accounts. You can:

* Keep them (e.g., **Bank**, **Sales Income**, **Utilities Expense**)
* Add your own (e.g., **Uber Ride Income**, **Delivery Fees**, **Fuel Expense**)

📝 **Example Accounts to Add:**

* 💰 **Bank Account** – where money comes in/out
* 📦 **Inventory** – if you sell products
* 📈 **Sales Income** – for all customer payments
* 🧾 **Marketing Expense** – ads, flyers
* 🚗 **Fuel Expense** – for Uber/gas

---

### ✅ STEP 4: **Link Your Bank Account (Optional but Powerful)**

This allows QuickBooks to:

* Pull in transactions automatically
* Categorize them for you
* Make reconciliation much easier

🔗 How:

1. Go to **Banking** tab
2. Click **Link Account**
3. Sign into your bank securely
4. Choose the date range for transactions to pull

---

### ✅ STEP 5: **Add Your Customers and Vendors**

* Customers = People who pay you (e.g., clients, platforms like Uber Eats)
* Vendors = People/companies you pay (e.g., gas stations, Facebook ads)

💡 You can add them manually or import them from a spreadsheet.

---

### ✅ STEP 6: **Start Recording Transactions**

If you didn’t link a bank, you can **enter them manually**:

* Click **+ New** at the top

  * Select **Invoice**, **Sales Receipt**, **Expense**, etc.
* Fill out each form with the amount, date, account, and notes

---

### ✅ STEP 7: **Categorize Transactions**

If you linked your bank:

* Go to **Banking**
* You’ll see **transactions to review**
* Click each one and choose the correct **category** (e.g., Fuel Expense, Sales Income)

---

### ✅ STEP 8: **Reconcile Your Bank Account**

At month-end:

1. Go to **Accounting > Reconcile**
2. Select your bank account
3. Enter the ending balance from your bank statement
4. Match transactions in QuickBooks to the real ones

✅ You should end with a \$0 difference.

---

### ✅ STEP 9: **Run Financial Reports**

Now that your books are up to date:

* Click **Reports**
* View:

  * **Profit & Loss** (income - expenses)
  * **Balance Sheet** (assets - liabilities)
  * **Cash Flow**

---

### ✅ STEP 10: **Keep It Going!**

* Update your books weekly or monthly
* Categorize and reconcile transactions regularly
* Back up your data or use cloud syncing

---
---


### ✅ When you run a **report in QuickBooks** (like Profit & Loss or Balance Sheet):

You **do NOT need to run reports separately** for each bank or credit card account — **QuickBooks includes everything automatically**.

---

### 🧾 Here's what happens:

#### 1. **Profit & Loss Report** (P\&L)

* **Shows your income and expenses**
* It doesn't care *where* the money came from (bank or credit card)
* It only shows the **category** (e.g., Sales Income, Fuel Expense, etc.)

➡️ Example:
If you buy gas with your credit card, it shows under **Fuel Expense** in the report — not “credit card.”

---

#### 2. **Balance Sheet Report**

* This report **does show each account separately** (bank, credit card, etc.)
* You will see:

  * ✅ All **Bank accounts** (under Assets)
  * 💳 All **Credit Cards** (under Liabilities)
  * 📈 Equity and other assets

---

### 💡 Summary:

| Report Type       | Do you need separate reports? | What it shows                       |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| **Profit & Loss** | ❌ No                          | Only income & expenses by category  |
| **Balance Sheet** | ❌ No (shows all in one)       | Bank, Credit Card, Equity, etc.     |
| **Cash Flow**     | ❌ No                          | Shows movement of money (bank only) |

---

---

Yes — **QuickBooks Online is perfect** for both:

---

### ✅ 1. **Your Own Business (e.g., Lili’s Uber Delivery)**

You can:

* Track **income from Uber rides or deliveries**
* Record **expenses** like fuel, car maintenance, tolls
* Link your **bank and credit card** to auto-import transactions
* Categorize everything for **tax time**
* Generate reports like **Profit & Loss**, **Mileage**, and **Tax Summary**

💡 **It helps you act like your own bookkeeper.**

---

### ✅ 2. **Virtual Bookkeeping Business (helping others)**

You can:

* Use QuickBooks to manage bookkeeping for other businesses
* Log in to **clients’ QuickBooks accounts remotely**
* Help them with:

  * Categorizing transactions
  * Reconciling bank statements
  * Sending invoices
  * Generating financial reports
* Become a **QuickBooks ProAdvisor** to get certified and attract clients

💼 It helps you be a **freelance or virtual bookkeeper**.

---

### 🧾 Example:

Let’s say you’re both:

* 👩‍💼 **Lili the Uber driver** — use QuickBooks to track your own rides, fuel, expenses
* 👩‍💻 **Lili the bookkeeper** — use QuickBooks to help clients like a bakery, online shop, handyman, etc.

---

### 💡 One Tip:

You should create **separate QuickBooks accounts**:

* One for your **personal Uber delivery business**
* One for **each client**, or log into their account as their bookkeeper

---

---

### ✅ WHY You Should Create Separate QuickBooks Accounts:

| Use Case                                   | Should You Use a Separate QuickBooks Account? | Why?                                                                 |
| ------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Your own Uber delivery business**        | ✅ Yes                                         | To keep your personal income and expenses separate from your clients |
| **Client bookkeeping work**                | ✅ Yes                                         | Each client must have their own QuickBooks file/account              |
| **Another business you own**               | ✅ Yes                                         | Each business needs its own books, bank links, and reports           |
| **Mixing multiple clients in one account** | ❌ No                                          | This causes confusion, incorrect reports, and tax issues             |

---

### 💡 Think of QuickBooks like a folder — one folder = one business.

If you’re running:

* 🚗 **Lili’s Uber Delivery**
* 📦 Helping a **Bakery**
* 💇 Helping a **Hair Salon**

👉 Each one needs its **own QuickBooks Online account** (or login access to theirs).

---

### ✅ HOW to Set It Up:

#### 1. **Your Own Uber Delivery:**

* Sign up at [quickbooks.intuit.com](https://quickbooks.intuit.com)
* Use your email and create a company called **“Lili’s Uber Delivery”**
* Set up accounts for **Uber Income**, **Fuel Expense**, **Car Maintenance**, etc.

#### 2. **Your Client’s Bookkeeping:**

* Ask the client to:

  * Invite you as their bookkeeper (via email)
  * OR give you access to their QuickBooks Online
* You do **NOT** need to create a new QuickBooks file — they already have one

#### 3. **Another Business You Own:**

* Log out of your Uber QuickBooks
* Sign up again with a **different email** (or the same if using QuickBooks Accountant)
* Set up a new file just for that business

---

### 🔄 Optional: Use **QuickBooks Online Accountant (QBOA)**

* If you're a bookkeeper helping clients, you can use **QuickBooks Online Accountant**
* It’s **free for bookkeepers**
* Lets you manage **multiple clients in one dashboard**

🔗 [Sign up for QBOA (free)](https://quickbooks.intuit.com/accountants/)

---

---


---

### ❌ No, you **should NOT use QuickBooks Online Accountant (QBOA)** for your **own Uber Delivery business.**

It’s designed for:

* 👩‍💻 **Bookkeepers and accountants**

* So they can access all their **clients’ books** in one place

---

### ✅ What you **should use** for **Lili’s Uber Delivery**:

Use a **regular QuickBooks Online** (QBO) subscription — this is what’s built for **business owners**.

---

### 🔄 Summary Table:

| Product                               | Purpose                                   | Use it for Uber? |
| ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| ✅ QuickBooks Online (QBO)             | For running your own business             | ✅ Yes            |
| ❌ QuickBooks Online Accountant (QBOA) | For managing client books as a bookkeeper | ❌ No             |

---

### 🔧 What You Can Do Instead:

2. ✅ Use **QuickBooks Online Accountant** (QBOA) to:

   * Help clients (like a bakery, salon, etc.)
   * Get **certified** and listed as a ProAdvisor

---

---

---

Great question! If you want to **invite your own Uber delivery business (Lili’s Uber Delivery)** to your **QuickBooks Online Accountant (QBOA)** account — here’s exactly how to do it in simple steps:

---

## ✅ Scenario:

You’re both the **business owner** and the **bookkeeper** (or want to practice using QBOA features on your own business).

---

## 🔧 Step-by-Step: Invite Lili’s Uber Delivery to QBOA

### 🔹 PART 1: Sign into **QuickBooks Online Accountant (QBOA)**

1. Go to [https://quickbooks.intuit.com/accountants/](https://quickbooks.intuit.com/accountants/)
2. Sign in with your **QBOA email** (not your business login)

---

### 🔹 PART 2: Add Your Uber Business as a Client

1. Once inside QBOA, click the **Clients** tab

2. Click **“Add Client”**

3. You’ll see 2 options:

   * **Add without QuickBooks** – just stores client info (skip this)
   * **Invite to QuickBooks Online** ✅ ← select this one

4. Fill in the details:

   * **Client Name**: Lili’s Uber Delivery
   * **Email**: Use your **QuickBooks business account email** (the one you used to create Lili’s Uber Delivery)
   * **Company Type**: Sole Proprietor
   * **Industry**: Transportation or Delivery
   * Check: **“Invite your client to QuickBooks”**

5. Click **“Save and send invitation”**

---

### 🔹 PART 3: Accept the Invite from Your Business Account

1. Go to the email inbox used for your Uber delivery QuickBooks account
2. Open the invite from QuickBooks
3. Click **Accept Invitation**
4. Sign in with the **business owner login**
5. You’ll now see **your business linked to your QBOA dashboard**

---

### ✅ What This Allows You to Do

* Access your business books from inside QBOA
* Switch between **your own Uber business** and any **client books**
* Practice offering services like reconciliation, categorizing, and reporting

---

### 🛑 IMPORTANT:

You must use **two different email addresses**:

* One for **QuickBooks Online Accountant** (QBOA)
* One for your **QuickBooks Online business** (Uber)

This separation is required by Intuit.

---

---

Great question! Here's the **simple answer**:

---

### ✅ **Generally, the invitation is sent by the QuickBooks Online Accountant (QBOA)**

**The Accountant (or Bookkeeper)** is the one who:

* Logs into their **QBOA dashboard**
* Clicks **“Add Client”** or **“Invite Client”**
* Sends the invitation to the **business owner’s email** (used in QuickBooks Online)

---

### 💡 Why?

Because in real life:

* The **accountant/bookkeeper** uses QBOA to manage multiple clients
* They initiate the connection so they can start working on the client’s books

---

### 🔁 BUT the Business Owner (QuickBooks Online) can also invite an accountant:

If the business owner is already using QuickBooks Online and wants to give access to an accountant:

#### 🔹 Steps for the **Business Owner**:

1. Sign in to **QuickBooks Online**
2. Go to ⚙️ **Gear icon > Manage users**
3. Click **“Accounting firms”**
4. Click **“Invite”**
5. Enter the accountant's **email address** (must be linked to a QBOA account)
6. Click **Send invitation**

✅ The accountant will get an email and can access the books in QBOA after accepting.

---

### ✅ Summary:

| Who Sends Invite                     | When and Why                                                                  |
| ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **QBOA (Accountant)**                | ✅ Most common – to add a new client and start managing their books            |
| **QuickBooks Online Business Owner** | ✅ If they already have QuickBooks and want to give access to their accountant |

---

Let me know which direction you’re going:

* Are **you** the bookkeeper inviting your own Uber business?
* Or are you trying to **grant access to your accountant**?
---
---

No — **QuickBooks Desktop Enterprise 24.0 (30‑day free trial)** is *not* the same as **QuickBooks Online Business**. Here’s a breakdown:

---

## 🖥️ QuickBooks Desktop Enterprise Trial

* A full-featured **desktop software trial** of the 24.0 version (Enterprise Gold/Platinum/Diamond), installed locally on your computer ([quickbooks.intuit.com](https://quickbooks.intuit.com/desktop/enterprise/contact/trial-download/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).
* Includes advanced capabilities like:

  * Advanced inventory management (bin tracking, barcode scanning)
  * Industry‑specific editions
  * Enhanced reporting and job tracking
  * Multi-user (up to 40 users)
  * Offline access
* You download and run it directly on your PC; no internet required to use once installed (apart from setup or updates) ([Ace Cloud Hosting](https://www.acecloudhosting.com/blog/quickbooks-online-vs-quickbooks-enterprise/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [quickbooks.intuit.com](https://quickbooks.intuit.com/products/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).

---

## ☁️ QuickBooks Online Business Trial

* A **cloud-based subscription** accessible from any browser or mobile app ([Method](https://www.method.me/blog/quickbooks-online-vs-enterprise/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).
* Offers convenience and remote work features:

  * Always up-to-date with automatic backups
  * Supports up to 25 users (Advanced plan)
  * Great for invoicing, expense tracking, basic inventory
  * Requires internet connection ([Method](https://www.method.me/blog/quickbooks-online-vs-enterprise/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [Ace Cloud Hosting](https://www.acecloudhosting.com/blog/quickbooks-online-vs-quickbooks-enterprise/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [quickbooks.intuit.com](https://quickbooks.intuit.com/desktop/enterprise/contact/trial-download/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).

---

## Main Differences

| Feature                   | Desktop Enterprise (Trial)             | Online Business (Trial)             |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| **Platform**              | Installed software on your computer    | Web-based/cloud access              |
| **Inventory & Reporting** | Advanced inventory, deep customization | Basic inventory, simpler reports    |
| **User Capacity**         | Up to 40 users                         | Up to \~25 users (Advanced)         |
| **Internet Requirement**  | Mostly offline (after install)         | Requires internet                   |
| **Access Flexibility**    | Local desktop access                   | Accessible anywhere via browser/app |

---

## ✅ So, is it the same?

**No**, they’re **entirely different products**:

* The *desktop trial* gives you the full desktop Enterprise experience for 30 days.
* The *online trial* gives you temporary access to the cloud-based QuickBooks Online.

If your goal is exploring the desktop version's capabilities, use the desktop Enterprise trial. If you're evaluating cloud access, choose the Online trial.

---

## 🔄 Migration & Conversion

Yes, Intuit allows you to **migrate data** from Desktop Enterprise (including trial) to QuickBooks Online within certain limits ([abilitybusiness.com](https://abilitybusiness.com/quickbooks-enterprise-or-quickbooks-online-for-my-business-needs/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [Method](https://www.method.me/blog/quickbooks-online-vs-enterprise/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [quickbooks.intuit.com](https://quickbooks.intuit.com/learn-support/en-us/other-questions/data-migration-from-quickbooks-desktop-trail-24-version-business/00/1457937?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [quickbooks.intuit.com](https://quickbooks.intuit.com/desktop/enterprise/contact/trial-download/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).

---

## 🔎 Recommendation

* Choose **Desktop Enterprise trial** if you need **heavy-duty inventory management, advanced job costing, offline use, or multi‑user desktop access**.
* Choose **Online Business trial** for **remote access, ease of use, web/mobile workflow**, and lighter accounting tasks.

---
---

Yes, you *can* invite your clients (or rather, your clients can invite *you* as their accountant) into **QuickBooks Desktop Enterprise Trial** through the **External Accountant** user feature:

---

### ✅ How it works in QuickBooks Desktop Enterprise

1. **Client sets you up as an External Accountant user:**

   * They go to **Company → Users → Set Up Users and Roles**.
   * Choose **New**, assign the **External Accountant** role (and optionally **Full Access**).
   * Enter your email and complete the invite process ([QuickBooks](https://quickbooks.intuit.com/learn-support/en-us/help-article/manage-users/set-external-accountant-user-quickbooks-desktop/L2acpmzY8_US_en_US?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [Firm of the Future](https://www.firmofthefuture.com/accounting/accountant-management-of-the-intuit-account/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [QuickBooks](https://quickbooks.intuit.com/learn-support/en-us/account-management/how-do-you-invite-your-accountant/00/233499/page/3?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).

2. **Invite is sent to your email:**

   * You’ll receive an email invitation tied to your Intuit account.
   * You’ll need to **accept** it (optional—you can still work as that user without accepting, but acceptance links the role to you).
   * Once accepted, you can log in using your own Intuit credentials ([Firm of the Future](https://www.firmofthefuture.com/accounting/accountant-management-of-the-intuit-account/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).

3. **Access and collaboration:**

   * You’ll appear as a user in their company file, with permissions based on the role given.
   * You can then work remotely with your client’s file—even during their Enterprise 24.0 free trial.

---

### 💡 Why this is useful during a Trial

* Even on the **30‑day free trial of Enterprise 24.0**, the user-role system works the same as the paid version.
* You don’t need your own Enterprise subscription—just an Intuit account linked to an External Accountant user in their file.
* This method allows secure, role-based collaboration without sharing admin credentials.

---

### 🛠 Quick Steps Recap

| Step          | Action                                                                            |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1. Client** | Company → Users → Set Up Users and Roles → New → External Accountant → email → OK |
| **2. You**    | Receive email → Accept invite (optional)                                          |
| **3. You**    | Log in with your Intuit account → gain access to their trial company file         |

---

### 🔗 Notes

* This is **not** like inviting clients in QuickBooks Online Accountant—this is *within the desktop file itself* ([YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1Ive3OtXJk&utm_source=chatgpt.com), [QuickBooks](https://quickbooks.intuit.com/learn-support/en-us/help-article/manage-users/create-manage-roles-quickbooks-desktop-enterprise/L9z3XdBcQ_US_en_US?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [Firm of the Future](https://www.firmofthefuture.com/accounting/accountant-management-of-the-intuit-account/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [QuickBooks](https://quickbooks.intuit.com/learn-support/en-us/help-article/payroll-subscriptions/add-clients-quickbooks-online-accountant/L6OvGOw2L_US_en_US?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).
* You won’t have to purchase anything or use a separate Online platform.

---

🎯 **In summary:** YES—you *can* be invited to your client’s Desktop Enterprise trial as an External Accountant user. Once invited and optionally accepted, you’ll be able to access and collaborate within their trial company file using your own Intuit credentials.

Let me know if you'd like a screenshot walkthrough or help with setting roles and permissions!
